GUI module for AI Task Extraction System

Note: This project uses a web-based interface (FastAPI) instead of a desktop GUI.
No PySide6 or similar GUI framework is used in this implementation.

The frontend is built with React and communicates with the FastAPI backend via REST API.

# This file is intentionally empty as this project uses a web-based frontend
# instead of a desktop GUI application.

# If you need to add GUI functionality in the future, you can implement it here
# using PySide6, Tkinter, or other Python GUI frameworks.
